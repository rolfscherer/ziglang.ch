Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.

## Robust
Behavior is correct even for edge cases such as out of memory.
## Optimal
Write programs the best way they can behave and perform.
## Reusable
The same code works in many environments which have different constraints.
## Maintainable
Precisely communicate intent to the compiler and other programmers. The language imposes a low overhead to reading code and is resilient to changing requirements and environments.
